# smallmatrix

## Overview
A simple matrix computation library using M1 GPU with [Metal API C++](https://github.com/bkaradzic/metal-cpp).

This is for [smalltensor](https://github.com/hbhungg/smalltensor) GPU backend.

## Why not Swift?
Cause I want to learn C++. (Not that Swift is not a good language)

## Why not [MetalPerformanceShader](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders) (MPS)?
That would kinda defeat the purpose of building your own matrix computation library.
Plus, this is a learning projects. We are trying to build stuff from the ground up.
